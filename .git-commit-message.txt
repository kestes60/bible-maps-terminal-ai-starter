chore(session): Day 1 foundation - data collection, agents, and documentation (2025-11-01)

Summary:
- Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md project guidance
- Documented 10 Joshua 10 locations with scholarly citations in sources.md
- Expanded places.example.geojson with multi-hypothesis approach
- Created Day 2 roadmap in TODO.md
- Established three specialized agents (Session Closer, Research Guru, Brutal Critic)

Key Decisions:
- OpenBible.info + Pleiades as primary authoritative sources
- Multi-hypothesis approach with 0.2-1.0 confidence scoring
- WGS84 coordinates with 4 decimal precision standard
- Agent-based quality workflow

Next Steps:
1. Add explicit CRS property to GeoJSON
2. Standardize coordinate precision to 4 decimals
3. Research Leaflet vs MapLibre GL JS for map implementation

Quality Metrics (Brutal Critic):
- Clarity: 8/10
- Evidence: 7/10
- Map Readiness: 6/10
- 5 critical fixes identified for Day 2

Files Modified:
- CLAUDE.md (created)
- data/sources.md (complete citations for 10 locations)
- data/places.example.geojson (expanded to 10 cities)
- tasks/TODO.md (Day 2 roadmap)
- SESSION_SUMMARY.md (Day 1 summary)
